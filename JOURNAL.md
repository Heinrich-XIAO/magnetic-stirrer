## 10/11/2025 - Make a BOM(b)  

Find some aliexpress parts to use for magnetic stirrer. I'm not gonna make my own pcb for this since its a pretty simple project. This project should only use aliexpress parts so that its cheap. IDK what else to put in this entry: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

## 11/6/2025 4 PM - Make electrical and assembly related drawings  

I made an image for the electrical stuff with cirkit designer and a concept of the assembly with excalidraw. I think all the components in the electrical drawing are the exact same except for the motor. Next thing I'll do is make some 3d files to act as a case.

It wasn't too difficult since the project is pretty simple, but I had to make the hole pretty big since I've had a lot of trouble in the past with holes for usb being too small, so now it's pretty tiny. also, there's no lid since a lid would make it basically impossible to do anything without taking everything apart, and i'll probably just superglue a layer of aluminium on it. (aluminium cuz it can't be magnetic).
