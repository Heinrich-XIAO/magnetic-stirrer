## 10/11/2025 - Make a BOM(b)  

Find some aliexpress parts to use for magnetic stirrer. I'm not gonna make my own pcb for this since its a pretty simple project. This project should only use aliexpress parts so that its cheap. IDK what else to put in this entry: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

## 11/6/2025 - Make electrical and assembly related drawings  

I made an image for the electrical stuff with cirkit designer and a concept of the assembly with excalidraw. I think all the components in the electrical drawing are the exact same except for the motor. Next thing I'll do is make some 3d files to act as a case.
