# Magnetic Stirrer (im too lazy to buy)

I made this because I got really interested in instant things (ex. instant coffee, instant tea, etc), and I also got interested in chemistry for some reason, and i don't really want to stir with a glass rod, so I wanted to make a magnetic stirrer, and normal magnetic stirrers are too expensive:sob:.
